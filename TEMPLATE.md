### Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.

### Configuration

There are a number of optional settings for you to configure. Use the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file in the repo and use the documentation below to configure your site:

#### Gem dependency settings

`twitter`, `author` and `social` values will need to be changed to the projects' social information or removed. Look for the `Gem settings` comment within the `/_config.yml` file. These values are for the [jekyll-seo-tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) - follow the link to find out more.

#### Site settings

You'll need to change the `description`, `title` and `url` to match with the project. You'll also need to replace the logos, default social and default offline images in the `/assets/` directory with your own graphics. Setting the site language can be done with `lang`, the theme will default to `en-US`. The `email` needs to be changed to the email you want to receive contact form enquires with. The `disqus` value can be changed to your project username on [Disqus](https://disqus.com), remove this from the `/_config.yml` file if you don't want comments enabled. Look for the `Site settings` comment within the `/_config.yml` file. The `repo` setting is optional, for now, and can be removed entirely, if you wish.

Google Analytics can be enabled via the site configuration too. Add your tracking ID to the `/_config.yml` file in the following method: `google_analytics: 'UA-XXXXXXXX-1'`. By default all IPs of site visitors are anonymous to maintain a level of privacy for the audience. If you wish to turn this off set the `google_analytics_anonymize_ip` key to `false`.

Date format can be customised in the `/_config.yml` with the option `date_format` (please refer to Liquid date filters documentation for learning about formatting possibilities). Only placeholder formatting is supported, do not try to use ordinal dates introduced in Jekyll 3.8.

The `short_name` option within `/_config.yml` is to add a custom name to the site's web application counterpart. When the website is added to a device this name will appear alonside the app icon. The short name will default to the site title if this isn't set.

#### Site performance settings

Alembic comes with a couple of options to enhance the speed and overall performance of the site you build upon it.

By default the built in Service Worker is enabled, and will work on a 'network first' method. Meaning if there's no internet connection the content the Service Worker has cached will be used until the connection comes back. It will always look for a live version of the code first. To disable the Service Worker add an option called `service_worker` with a value of `false` in the `/_config.yml` file.

Another option to speed up Alembic is to enable inline CSS, which is off by default. You can enable this by setting `css_inline: true` inside your `/_config.yml` file. By switching to inline styles you bypass the use `/assets/styles.scss`, any custom styles will need to be added in `/_includes/site-styles.html` or in a new custom file.

Please note that these options aren't a "silver bullet" for making your site faster, make sure to audit and debug your site to get the best performance for your situation.

#### Site navigation

There are a total of 4 different navigation types:

- `navigation_header`: The links shown in the header (it is also used on the 404 page)
- `navigation_footer`: The links shown in the footer
- `social_links`: The social icon links that are shown in the sidebar
- `sharing_links`: The social sharing buttons that are shown at the bottom of blog posts

All navigations can be edited using the `_config.yml` file. To see example usage either look for the `Site navigation` comment within the `/_config.yml` file or see [the nav-share.html include](#nav-sharehtml).

If there are no items for the `navigation_header` or `navigation_footer`, they will fallback to a list of pages within the site. The `social_navigation` properties should either be one that is already in the list (so `Twitter` or `Facebook`) or a regular `link`, this is so an icon can be set for the link.

#### Custom fonts

Alembic comes with custom fonts served from Google fonts. By default it requests Merriweather but this can be any font from any provider assuming it supports requesting fonts in the same manner and does not require javascript.

This can be configured under the `custom_fonts` key.

- `urls`: The urls supplied to you from your font provider (eg https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Merriweather). For best performance try to use as few urls as possible
- `preconnect`: (optional) If your font provider serves the font files from another domain it can be useful to make a connection to that domain in advance. For example google load the font files from fonts.gstatic.com. This can be omitted if not required

If you want to customise this further you can find the include for custom fonts in `_includes/site-custom-fonts.html`.

### Using includes

There are 2 main types of includes: ones designed for the site and ones that are designed as shortcodes. Here are a list of the shortcode includes:

#### `button.html`
A button that can link to a page of any kind.

Example usage: `{% include button.html text="I'm a button" link="https://david.darn.es" %}`

Available options:
- `text`: The text of the button _required_
- `link`: The link that the button goes to _required_
- `icon`: The icon that is added to the end of the button text
- `color`: The colour of the button

#### `figure.html`
An image with optional caption.

Example usage: `{% include figure.html image="/uploads/feature-image.jpg" caption="Check out my photo" %}`

Available options:
- `image`: The image shown _required_
- `caption`: A caption to explain the image
- `position`: The position of the image; `left`, `right` or `center`
- `width` & `height`: Optional width and height attributes of the containing image

#### `icon.html`
An icon.

Example usage: `{% include icon.html id="twitter" %}`

Available options:
- `id`: The reference for the icon _required_
- `title`: The accessible label for the icon
- `color`: The desired colour of the icon
- `width` & `height`: Width and height attributes for the icon, default is `16`

#### `nav-share.html`
A set of buttons that share the current page to various social networks, which is controlled within the `_config.yml` file under the `sharing_links` keyword.

Example usage: `{% include nav-share.html %}`

Available options:
``` yml
Twitter: "#1DA1F2"
facebook: "#3B5998"
Pinterest: "#BD081C"
LinkedIn: "#0077B5"
tumblr: "#36465D"
Reddit: "#FF4500"
HackerNews: "#ff6600"
DesignerNews: "#2D72D9"
Email: true
```

_The first item is the name of the network (must be one of the ones stated above) and the second is the colour of the button. To remove a button remove the line of the same name._

#### `video.html`
A YouTube video.

Example usage: `{% include video.html id="zrkcGL5H3MU" %}`

Available options:
- `id`: The YouTube ID for the video _required_

#### `map.html`
A Google map. _See Google [My Maps](https://www.google.com/mymaps)_

Example usage: `{% include map.html id="1UT-2Z-Vg_MG_TrS5X2p8SthsJhc" %}`

Available options:
- `id`: The map ID for the map _required_

#### `site-form.html`
Adds a contact form to the page. This can be used with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/) depending on your setup.

Example usage: `{% include site-form.html %}`

Available options:
- `netlify_form=true`: Set whether you would like to use Netlify Forms, otherwise the form will default to Formspree
- `name`: Give the form a name, by default the form is called "Contact". The name will be reflected when form submissions come through in Netlify or in your email client. The name is also used in the label and input elements for accessibility


Use the `email` option in the `/_config.yml` to change to the desired email.

#### `site-search.html`
Adds a search form to the page.

Example usage: `{% include site-search.html %}`

This include has no options. This include will add a block of javascript to the page and javascript reference in order for the search field to work correctly.

#### `site-before-start.html` & `site-before-end.html`
Optional html includes for adding scripts, css, js or any embed code you wish to add to every page without the need to overwrite the entire `default.html` template.

**Example usage:** These are different to other includes as they are designed to be overwritten. If you create a `site-before-start.html` file in the `_includes/` the contents of the file will be included immediately before the closing `</head>` tag. If you create a `site-before-end.html` file the contents of the file will be included immediately before the closing `</body>` tag.

### Page layouts

As well as `page`, `post`, `blog`, there are a few alternative layouts that can be used on pages:

- `categories`: Shows all posts grouped by category, with an index of categories in a left hand sidebar
- `search`: Adds a search field to the page as well as a simplified version of the sidebar to allow more focus on the search results

### Page and Post options

There are some more specific options you can apply when creating a page or a post:

- `aside: true`: Adds a sidebar to the page or post, this is false by default and will not appear
- `comments: false`: Turns off comments for that post
- `feature_image: "/uploads/feature-image.jpg"`: Adds a full width feature image at the top of the page
- `feature_text: "Example text"`: Adds text to the top of the page as a full width feature with solid colour; supports markdown. This can be used in conjunction with the `feature_image` option to create a feature image with text over it
- `indexing: false`: Adds a `noindex` meta element to the `<head>` to stop crawler bots from indexing the page, used on the 404 page

> **Note:** The Post List Page options are actually in the collection data within the `_config.yml` file.

* If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the [issue will be closed](#clean-up-issues-and-prs). If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.

### Report an Error or Bug

If you run into an error or bug with the project:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/issues
* Include *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error on their own.
* Provide project and platform versions (jekyll, ruby, etc), depending on what seems relevant. If not, please be ready to provide that information if maintainers ask for it.

Once it's filed:

* The project team will [label the issue](#label-issues).
* A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no repro steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
* If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#contribute-code).
* If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the [issue will be closed](#clean-up-issues-and-prs). If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.
* `critical` issues may be left open, depending on perceived immediacy and severity, even past the 30 day deadline.

### Request a Feature

If the project doesn't do something you need or want it to do:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/issues
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
* Please try and be clear about why existing features and alternatives would not work for you.

Once it's filed:

* The project team will [label the issue](#label-issues).
* The project team will evaluate the feature request, possibly asking you more questions to understand its purpose and any relevant requirements. If the issue is closed, the team will convey their reasoning and suggest an alternative path forward.
* If the feature request is accepted, it will be marked for implementation with `feature-accepted`, which can then be done by either by a core team member or by anyone in the community who wants to [contribute code](#contribute-code).

Note: The team is unlikely to be able to accept every single feature request that is filed. Please understand if they need to say no.

### Project Setup

So you wanna contribute some code! That's great! This project uses GitHub Pull Requests to manage contributions, so [read up on how to fork a GitHub project and file a PR](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking) if you've never done it before.

If this seems like a lot or you aren't able to do all this setup, you might also be able to [edit the files directly](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) without having to do any of this setup. Yes, [even code](#contribute-code).

If you want to go the usual route and run the project locally, though:

* [Install bundler](hhttp://bundler.io/#getting-started)
* [Fork the project](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork)

Then in your terminal:
* `$ bundle install`
* `$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`

And you should be ready to go!

### Contribute Documentation

Documentation is a super important, critical part of this project. Docs are how we keep track of what we're doing, how, and why. It's how we stay on the same page about our policies. And it's how we tell others everything they need in order to be able to use this project -- or contribute to it. So thank you in advance.

Documentation contributions of any size are welcome! Feel free to file a PR even if you're just rewording a sentence to be more clear, or fixing a spelling mistake!

To contribute documentation:

* [Set up the project](#project-setup).
* Edit or add any relevant documentation.
* Make sure your changes are formatted correctly and consistently with the rest of the documentation.
* Re-read what you wrote, and run a spellchecker on it to make sure you didn't miss anything.
* In your commit message(s), begin the first line with `docs: `. For example: `docs: Adding a doc contrib section to CONTRIBUTING.md`.
* Write clear, concise commit message(s) using [conventional-changelog format](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md). Documentation commits should use `docs(<component>): <message>`.
* Go to https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/pulls and open a new pull request with your changes.
* If your PR is connected to an open issue, add a line in your PR's description that says `Fixes: #123`, where `#123` is the number of the issue you're fixing.

Once you've filed the PR:

* One or more maintainers will use GitHub's review feature to review your PR.
* If the maintainer asks for any changes, edit your changes, push, and ask for another review.
* If the maintainer decides to pass on your PR, they will thank you for the contribution and explain why they won't be accepting the changes. That's ok! We still really appreciate you taking the time to do it, and we don't take that lightly. 💚
* If your PR gets accepted, it will be marked as such, and merged into the `master` branch soon after. Your contribution will be distributed to the masses next time the maintainers [tag a release](#tag-a-release)

### Contribute Code

We like code commits a lot! They're super handy, and they keep the project going and doing the work it needs to do to be useful to others.

Code contributions of just about any size are acceptable!

The main difference between code contributions and documentation contributions is that contributing code requires inclusion of relevant tests for the code being added or changed. Contributions without accompanying tests will be held off until a test is added, unless the maintainers consider the specific tests to be either impossible, or way too much of a burden for such a contribution.

To contribute code:

* [Set up the project](#project-setup).
* Make any necessary changes to the source code.
* Include any [additional documentation](#contribute-documentation) the changes might need.
* Write clear, concise commit message(s) using [conventional-changelog format](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md).
* Go to https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/pulls and open a new pull request with your changes.
* If your PR is connected to an open issue, add a line in your PR's description that says `Fixes: #123`, where `#123` is the number of the issue you're fixing.

Once you've filed the PR:

* One or more maintainers will use GitHub's review feature to review your PR.
* If the maintainer asks for any changes, edit your changes, push, and ask for another review. Additional tags (such as `needs tests`) will be added depending on the review.
* If the maintainer decides to pass on your PR, they will thank you for the contribution and explain why they won't be accepting the changes. That's ok! We still really appreciate you taking the time to do it, and we don't take that lightly. 💚
* If your PR gets accepted, it will be marked as such, and merged into the `master` branch soon after. Your contribution will be distributed to the masses next time the maintainers publish an update.

### Provide Support on Issues

[Needs Collaborator](#join-the-project-team): none

Helping out other users with their questions is a really awesome way of contributing to any community. It's not uncommon for most of the issues on an open source projects being support-related questions by users trying to understand something they ran into, or find their way around a known bug.

Sometimes, the `support` label will be added to things that turn out to actually be other things, like bugs or feature requests. In that case, suss out the details with the person who filed the original issue, add a comment explaining what the bug is, and change the label from `support` to `bug` or `feature`. If you can't do this yourself, @mention a maintainer so they can do it.

In order to help other folks out with their questions:

* Go to the issue tracker and [filter open issues by the `support` label](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asupport).
* Read through the list until you find something that you're familiar enough with to give an answer to.
* Respond to the issue with whatever details are needed to clarify the question, or get more details about what's going on.
* Once the discussion wraps up and things are clarified, either close the issue, or ask the original issue filer (or a maintainer) to close it for you.

Some notes on picking up support issues:

* Avoid responding to issues you don't know you can answer accurately.
* As much as possible, try to refer to past issues with accepted answers. Link to them from your replies with the `#123` format.
* Be kind and patient with users -- often, folks who have run into confusing things might be upset or impatient. This is ok. Try to understand where they're coming from, and if you're too uncomfortable with the tone, feel free to stay away or withdraw from the issue. (note: if the user is outright hostile or is violating the CoC, [refer to the Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to resolve the conflict).

### Label Issues

[Needs Collaborator](#join-the-project-team): Issue Tracker

One of the most important tasks in handling issues is labelling them usefully and accurately. All other tasks involving issues ultimately rely on the issue being classified in such a way that relevant parties looking to do their own tasks can find them quickly and easily.

In order to label issues, [open up the list of unlabelled issues](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Alabel) and, **from newest to oldest**, read through each one and apply issue labels according to the table below. If you're unsure about what label to apply, skip the issue and try the next one: don't feel obligated to label each and every issue yourself!

Label | Apply When | Notes
--- | --- | ---
`bug` | Cases where the code (or documentation) is behaving in a way it wasn't intended to. | If something is happening that surprises the *user* but does not go against the way the code is designed, it should use the `enhancement` label.
`critical` | Added to `bug` issues if the problem described makes the code completely unusable in a common situation. |
`documentation` | Added to issues or pull requests that affect any of the documentation for the project. | Can be combined with other labels, such as `bug` or `enhancement`.
`duplicate` | Added to issues or PRs that refer to the exact same issue as another one that's been previously labeled. | Duplicate issues should be marked and closed right away, with a message referencing the issue it's a duplicate of (with `#123`)
`enhancement` | Added to [feature requests](#request-a-feature), PRs, or documentation issues that are purely additive: the code or docs currently work as expected, but a change is being requested or suggested. |
`help wanted` | Applied by [Committers](#join-the-project-team) to issues and PRs that they would like to get outside help for. Generally, this means it's lower priority for the maintainer team to itself implement, but that the community is encouraged to pick up if they so desire | Never applied on first-pass labelling.
`in progress` | Applied by [Committers](#join-the-project-team) to PRs that are pending some work before they're ready for review. | The original PR submitter should @mention the team member that applied the label once the PR is complete.
`starter` | Applied by [Committers](#join-the-project-team) to issues that they consider good introductions to the project for people who have not contributed before. These are not necessarily "easy", but rather focused around how much context is necessary in order to understand what needs to be done for this project in particular. | Existing project members are expected to stay away from these unless they increase in priority.
`support` | This issue is either asking a question about how to use the project, clarifying the reason for unexpected behaviour, or possibly reporting a `bug` but does not have enough detail yet to determine whether it would count as such. | The label should be switched to `bug` if reliable reproduction steps are provided. Issues primarily with unintended configurations of a user's environment are not considered bugs, even if they cause crashes.
`wontfix` | Labellers may apply this label to issues that clearly have nothing at all to do with the project or are otherwise entirely outside of its scope/sphere of influence. [Committers](#join-the-project-team) may apply this label and close an issue or PR if they decide to pass on an otherwise relevant issue. | The issue or PR should be closed as soon as the label is applied, and a clear explanation provided of why the label was used. Contributors are free to contest the labelling, but the decision ultimately falls on committers as to whether to accept something or not.

### Clean Up Issues and PRs

[Needs Collaborator](#join-the-project-team): Issue Tracker

Issues and PRs can go stale after a while. Maybe they're abandoned. Maybe the team will just plain not have time to address them any time soon.

In these cases, they should be closed until they're brought up again or the interaction starts over.

To clean up issues and PRs:

* Search the issue tracker for issues or PRs, and add the term `updated:<=YYYY-MM-DD`, where the date is 30 days before today.
* Go through each issue *from oldest to newest*, and close them if **all of the following are true**:
  * not opened by a maintainer
  * not marked as `critical`
  * not marked as `starter` or `help wanted` (these might stick around for a while, in general, as they're intended to be available)
  * no explicit messages in the comments asking for it to be left open
  * does not belong to a milestone
* Leave a message when closing saying "Cleaning up stale issue. Please reopen or ping us if and when you're ready to resume this. See https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/latest/CONTRIBUTING.md#clean-up-issues-and-prs for more details."

### Review Pull Requests

[Needs Collaborator](#join-the-project-team): Issue Tracker

While anyone can comment on a PR, add feedback, etc, PRs are only *approved* by team members with Issue Tracker or higher permissions.

PR reviews use [GitHub's own review feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/), which manages comments, approval, and review iteration.

Some notes:

* You may ask for minor changes ("nitpicks"), but consider whether they are really blockers to merging: try to err on the side of "approve, with comments".
* *ALL PULL REQUESTS* should be covered by a test: either by a previously-failing test, an existing test that covers the entire functionality of the submitted code, or new tests to verify any new/changed behaviour. All tests must also pass and follow established conventions. Test coverage should not drop, unless the specific case is considered reasonable by maintainers.
* Please make sure you're familiar with the code or documentation being updated, unless it's a minor change (spellchecking, minor formatting, etc). You may @mention another project member who you think is better suited for the review, but still provide a non-approving review of your own.
* Be extra kind: people who submit code/doc contributions are putting themselves in a pretty vulnerable position, and have put time and care into what they've done (even if that's not obvious to you!) -- always respond with respect, be understanding, but don't feel like you need to sacrifice your standards for their sake, either. Just don't be a jerk about it?

### Join the Project Team

#### Ways to Join

There are many ways to contribute! Most of them don't require any official status unless otherwise noted. That said, there's a couple of positions that grant special repository abilities, and this section describes how they're granted and what they do.

All of the below positions are granted based on the project team's needs, as well as their consensus opinion about whether they would like to work with the person and think that they would fit well into that position. The process is relatively informal, and it's likely that people who express interest in participating can just be granted the permissions they'd like.

You can spot a collaborator on the repo by looking for the `[Collaborator]` or `[Owner]` tags next to their names.

Permission | Description
--- | ---
Issue Tracker | Granted to contributors who express a strong interest in spending time on the project's issue tracker. These tasks are mainly [labelling issues](#label-issues), [cleaning up old ones](#clean-up-issues-and-prs), and [reviewing pull requests](#review-pull-requests), as well as all the usual things non-team-member contributors can do. Issue handlers should not merge pull requests, tag releases, or directly commit code themselves: that should still be done through the usual pull request process. Becoming an Issue Handler means the project team trusts you to understand enough of the team's process and context to implement it on the issue tracker.
Committer | Granted to contributors who want to handle the actual pull request merges, tagging new versions, etc. Committers should have a good level of familiarity with the codebase, and enough context to understand the implications of various changes, as well as a good sense of the will and expectations of the project team.
Admin/Owner | Granted to people ultimately responsible for the project, its community, etc.

## Code of Conduct

### When Something Happens

If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:

1. Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s) or commits.
2. That person should immediately stop the behaviour and correct the issue.
3. If this doesn’t happen, or if you're uncomfortable speaking up, [contact the maintainers](#contacting-maintainers).
4. As soon as available, a maintainer will look into the issue, and take [further action (see below)](#further-enforcement), starting with a warning, then temporary block, then long-term repo or organisation ban.

When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.

**The maintainer team will prioritise the well-being and comfort of the recipients of the violation over the comfort of the violator.** See [some examples below](#enforcement-examples).

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of this project pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, technical preferences, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

  * Using welcoming and inclusive language.
  * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
  * Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
  * Focusing on what is best for the community.
  * Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members.
  * Encouraging and raising up your peers in the project so you can all bask in hacks and glory.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

  * The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances, including when simulated online. The only exception to sexual topics is channels/spaces specifically for topics of sexual identity.
  * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
  * Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.
  * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of "outing" of any aspect of someone's identity without their consent.
  * Publishing private screenshots or quotes of interactions in the context of this project without all quoted users' *explicit* consent.
  * Publishing of private communication that doesn't have to do with reporting harassment.
  * Any of the above even when [presented as "ironic" or "joking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism).
  * Any attempt to present "reverse-ism" versions of the above as violations. Examples of reverse-isms are "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", "heterophobia", and "cisphobia".
  * Unsolicited explanations under the assumption that someone doesn't already know it. Ask before you teach! Don't assume what people's knowledge gaps are.
  * [Feigning or exaggerating surprise](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-feigned-surprise) when someone admits to not knowing something.
  * "[Well-actuallies](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-well-actuallys)"
  * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within spaces involving this project and in other spaces involving community members. This includes the repository, its Pull Requests and Issue tracker, its Twitter community, private email communications in the context of the project, and any events where members of the project are participating, as well as adjacent communities and venues affecting the project's members.

Depending on the violation, the maintainers may decide that violations of this code of conduct that have happened outside of the scope of the community may deem an individual unwelcome, and take appropriate action to maintain the comfort and safety of its members.

#### Other Community Standards

As a project on GitHub, this project is additionally covered by the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/).

Additionally, as a project hosted on npm, is is covered by [npm, Inc's Code of Conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct).

Enforcement of those guidelines after violations overlapping with the above are the responsibility of the entities, and enforcement may happen in any or all of the services/communities.

### Maintainer Enforcement Process

Once the maintainers get involved, they will follow a documented series of steps and do their best to preserve the well-being of project members. This section covers actual concrete steps.

#### Contacting Maintainers

You may get in touch with the maintainer team through any of the following methods:

  * Through email:
    * [me@daviddarnes.com](mailto:me@daviddarnes.com) (David Darnes)

  * Through Twitter:
    * [@DavidDarnes](https://twitter.com/DavidDarnes) (David Darnes)

#### Further Enforcement

If you've already followed the [initial enforcement steps](#enforcement), these are the steps maintainers will take for further enforcement, as needed:

  1. Repeat the request to stop.
  2. If the person doubles down, they will have offending messages removed or edited by a maintainers given an official warning. The PR or Issue may be locked.
  3. If the behaviour continues or is repeated later, the person will be blocked from participating for 24 hours.
  4. If the behaviour continues or is repeated after the temporary block, a long-term (6-12mo) ban will be used.

On top of this, maintainers may remove any offending messages, images, contributions, etc, as they deem necessary.

Maintainers reserve full rights to skip any of these steps, at their discretion, if the violation is considered to be a serious and/or immediate threat to the health and well-being of members of the community. These include any threats, serious physical or verbal attacks, and other such behaviour that would be completely unacceptable in any social setting that puts our members at risk.

Members expelled from events or venues with any sort of paid attendance will not be refunded.

#### Who Watches the Watchers?

Maintainers and other leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership. These may include anything from removal from the maintainer team to a permanent ban from the community.

Additionally, as a project hosted on both GitHub and npm, [their own Codes of Conducts may be applied against maintainers of this project](#other-community-standards), externally of this project's procedures.

#### Enforcement Examples

##### The Best Case

The vast majority of situations work out like this. This interaction is common, and generally positive.

> Alex: "Yeah I used X and it was really crazy!"

> Patt (not a maintainer): "Hey, could you not use that word? What about 'ridiculous' instead?"

> Alex: "oh sorry, sure." -> edits old comment to say "it was really confusing!"

##### The Maintainer Case

Sometimes, though, you need to get maintainers involved. Maintainers will do their best to resolve conflicts, but people who were harmed by something **will take priority**.

> Patt: "Honestly, sometimes I just really hate using $library and anyone who uses it probably sucks at their job."

> Alex: "Whoa there, could you dial it back a bit? There's a CoC thing about attacking folks' tech use like that."

> Patt: "I'm not attacking anyone, what's your problem?"

> Alex: "@maintainers hey uh. Can someone look at this issue? Patt is getting a bit aggro. I tried to nudge them about it, but nope."

> KeeperOfCommitBits: (on issue) "Hey Patt, maintainer here. Could you tone it down? This sort of attack is really not okay in this space."

> Patt: "Leave me alone I haven't said anything bad wtf is wrong with you."

> KeeperOfCommitBits: (deletes user's comment), "@patt I mean it. Please refer to the CoC over at (URL to this CoC) if you have questions, but you can consider this an actual warning. I'd appreciate it if you reworded your messages in this thread, since they made folks there uncomfortable. Let's try and be kind, yeah?"

> Patt: "@keeperofbits Okay sorry. I'm just frustrated and I'm kinda burnt out and I guess I got carried away. I'll DM Alex a note apologising and edit my messages. Sorry for the trouble."

> KeeperOfCommitBits: "@patt Thanks for that. I hear you on the stress. Burnout sucks :/.  Have a good one!"

##### The Nope Case

> PepeTheFrog🐸: "Hi, I am a literal actual nazi and I think white supremacists are quite fashionable."

> Patt: "NOOOOPE. OH NOPE NOPE."

> Alex: "JFC NO. NOPE. @keeperofbits NOPE NOPE LOOK HERE"

> KeeperOfCommitBits: "👀 Nope. NOPE NOPE NOPE. 🔥"

> PepeTheFrog🐸 has been banned from all organisation or user repositories belonging to KeeperOfCommitBits.
